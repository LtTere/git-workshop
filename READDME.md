# .gitignore assignment

This assignment uses a basic understanding of git and show the use of a .gitignore file in a repo

A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. [More information](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

Please answer the following questions in the same file. 1 commit per question:

1. What happends if I add a file to .gitignore that is already been tracked by git?

2. How do I force to track a file that is in .gitignore?

3. How to make Git “forget” about a file that was tracked but is now in .gitignore?

4. .gitignore uses [globbing patterns](http://linux.die.net/man/7/glob). How do I ignore all files except the ones I need

5. How do I ignore any css files in the project?

6. How can I 'git commit' a file and ignore its content changes?
